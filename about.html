<h4 id="aboutInformation">
    Kanji Guesser is a program that gives you the opportunity to practice your awesome and amazing kanji skills.

    Note that Kanji Guesser is just a side project, and progress/updates may stop at any time.
    It is by no means perfect, and may have plenty of design imperfections. Design is not my strong point.
    I take no responsibility whatsoever regarding issues that may or may not occur when you are using Kanji Guesser.
