  Kanji Guesser is a simple program that provides you an opportunity to test your kanji skills.
  In order to play, begin by clicking the "Select Level" button on the main page.
  Then click the button associated with the JLPT(Japanese Language Proficiency Test) level that you want to test your skills in.
  Once you have selected a level, you may have to wait for a short moment, for the first kanji to load in.
  The English meaning(translation) may be inserted in the text field(below the kanji, above the check kanji button).
  For the moment, you need to manually click the "next kanji" button to proceed to the next kanji.
  If you are unsure regarding the kanji meaning, you can always click the "Show hint" button on the right side,
  where you will be able to
  see the meaning(s), on-reading(s), and kun-reading(s), of the current kanji.
