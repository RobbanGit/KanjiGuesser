# KanjiGuesser

KanjiGuesser is a simple application to test your kanji skills. The project is still in it's early stages, which means that a lot of things lack perfection.

I allow any individual/organization the permission to fork the project. 
If a fork is made, a reference to me would be appreciated, but not a must. 

This is just a personal project, which means that updates/changes may occur spontaneously, and the project may reach a permanent standstill at any point.

## Appreciations to
